Description: Provides a fast and efficient bridge between R and the Concise
    Binary Object Representation (CBOR), a binary data format defined in
    Bormann and Hoffman (2020) <doi:10.17487/RFC8949>. The core serialization
    and deserialization logic is implemented in 'Rust' for maximum performance
    and safety, making it ideal for applications where data transfer speed and
    low overhead are critical. The package provides two primary functions:
    `encode()` to serialize R objects into raw byte vectors and `decode()`
    to deserialize them back into R objects.
